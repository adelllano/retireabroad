        <p>Retire Abroad is a data-driven visualization guide to helping prospective retirees find their overseas destination. The website aims to provide a 'one-stop shop' experience that allows users to view information on cost of living, healthcare, crime, and many other important topics that could help users make decisions on where to retire. The 12 countries chosen are derived from multiple articles that consistantly have these countries on their "Top 10" list of places to retire.
        </p>
        <p>The data used in the cost of living, healthcare, and crime section were pulled from <a href="https://www.numbeo.com" id='copylinks'>Numbeo.com</a>, a crowd-sourced database that provides current information on living conditions in each country and/or city in the world. The indexed data, such as for <a href="https://www.numbeo.com/health-care/indices_explained.jsp" id='copylinks'>healthcare</a> and <a href="https://www.numbeo.com/crime/indices_explained.jsp" id='copylinks'>crime</a>, come from surveys completed by users that include questions based on perception (of either healthcare quality or crime levels).
        </p>
        <p>Since this website is geared towards individuals seeking retirement overseas and not current residents of these countries, I thought it was pertinent to include the life expectancy over the age of 60 for each country, including the USA. The data in this section was pulled from the <a href="http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?q=life+expectancy&d=WHO&f=MEASURE_CODE%3aWHOSIS_000015" id='copylinks'>Worl Health Organization (WHO)</a>.
        <p>The Data By Country section is included in the last section to allow users to view the data in a summarized format in case they already have a destination in mind. This section is also meant to provide details on other topics of interest, such as population count, language spoken, and climate.
        </p>
        <p>I hope this website serves to guide prospective retirees in their journey to finding a retirmenet destination that fits their needs and lifestyle.
