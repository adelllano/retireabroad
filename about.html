        <p>Retire Abroad is a data-driven visualization guide to helping prospective retirees find their overseas destination. The website aims to provide a 'one stop shop' experience that allows users to view information on cost of living, healthcare, crime, and many other important topics that could help users make decisions on where to retire. The 12 countries chosen are derived from multiple articles that consistantly have these countries on their "Top 10" list of places to retire.
        </p>
        <p>The data used in the cost of living, healthcare, and crime section were pulled from <a href="https://www.numbeo.com" id='copylinks'>Numbeo.com</a>, a crowd-sourced database that provides current information on living conditions in each country and/or city in the world. The indexed data, such as for <a href="https://www.numbeo.com/health-care/indices_explained.jsp" id='copylinks'>healthcare</a> and <a href="https://www.numbeo.com/crime/indices_explained.jsp" id='copylinks'>crime</a>, come from surveys completed by users that include questions based on user perception.
